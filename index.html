<h1>Welcome to Gabi's Webpage </h1>
<h3>Here is a little about me.</h3>
<p>I am a Computer Science major at Brigham Young University - Idaho. I also work at the David O. McKay Library while going to school. My hobbies include volleyball, dancing, watercoloring, and hanging out with my friends. 
Also, in my spare time, if I am not watching the latest Doctor Who episode, I most likely will be building crazy projects. Like this summer, I made a projector using a shoebox, a microscope lense, and some tape. (I never said it worked well. :) )
My dream goals are learning how to surf and for my best friend and I to make it in Hollywood next year as actresses and singers. </p>
